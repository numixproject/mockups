        <title>Introducing the Numix Store</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#555555;&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Even if have the best product in the world, it will not sale much, unless you popularise it and provide easy way to sell it. Up until now we’ve been using the Ubuntu Software Centre to sell our GTK themes and Icon themes for Ubuntu and DeviantArt to do the same for all the other distros. However whilst dA does to job, we are well aware that it is imperfect and in all honesty it can sometimes be tricky for both us and you to use. For example there is this as frustrating as having to cope up with Elena from Vampire Diaries for 6 seasons, bug where uploading does not work from the first or the second or the third … or the etc … time. Another con from using dA is the fact you will have to buy points, with chch you can buy products. When we decided we are going to sell t-shirts too, the only solution for us was to open up our own web store.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The road to the store.&lt;/b&gt;
We announced that we’re making a web store a while ago, but sadly we couldn’t make it as fast as we wanted to, because we didn’t have much experience with setuping opencart. Our adorable web developing hamster - &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/107080331539861558818&quot;&gt;ahmar siddiqui&lt;/a&gt; can only work on Numix in his free time and of course there were the issues we had to fix along the road. But no matter now, the important thing is that the store is now up and buying paid Numix products is now easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about those of us who have already purchased pain Numix products from dA?
For the time being you will still have to rely on dA, but we will do our best to fix that. Trust us, we don’t want to deal with dA anymore than you do. Perhaps we won’t that even less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wait! Didn’t you say something about Numix t-shirts?&lt;/b&gt;
Damn right we did, dearies. You can order one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://numixproject.org/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=60&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please note that international shipping can be costly to your destination and there is nothing we can do about that. However you’re buying something to show off with and supporting us. Of course ordering more than 1 t-shirt will not mean the shipping costs will increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But there are issue with the store.&lt;/b&gt;
Well, it would have been scary if there wasn’t. If you find an issue please &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/numixproject/numix-store/issues&quot;&gt;report it&lt;/a&gt; and we will do our best to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is the store secure?&lt;/b&gt;
Yes, it is. It is even behind a SSL certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, where is the store?&lt;/b&gt;
On 22 Acacia Avenue of course. :P &lt;a href=&quot;https://numixproject.org/store/&quot;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to get beamed to the location really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our valentine present for you - Fold icon pack for free!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#555555;&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;So, today is 14th of February and unless you are really out of the loop, you should know that most countries celebrate St. Valentine’s day also known as the day of love. The historical St. Valentine was a before schism third century Roman priest that. During the High Middle Ages, the day on which he is commemorated - 14th of February, became associated with Courtly love and that tradition evolved in today’s day about all things love, cuddling, plush toys and chocolate boxes. We shall however not dwell more on that, because there is very little confirmed historical info about this person.
Those of you who don’t have a person with which to celebrate St. Valentine’s day and feel blue about that should know that in Bulgaria 14th of February is also the day of people who make wine, so you can sit quietly at home and drink wine whilst watching “Vampire Diaries”. Just make sure you watch episodes with Katherine in them. :)&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after that charming introduction - it is now time to go to business.
Recently we announced that on 14th February we will make one of &lt;strong&gt;our paid Android icon themes free&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://numixproject.github.io/blog/2015/01/31/free-icon-pack.html&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; and we gave you the ability to choose which one by voting for your favourite on &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/b/115833527622591803679/115833527622591803679/posts/4qtP5WxnkqQ&quot;&gt;Google+.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.ggpht.com/d6m15TjkwW0W9kpXFaHzr_5lND6DnWSTLeG24spWam5budXXKYcPDCatPe2APW1KFBo=h900-rw&quot; alt=&quot;Numix Fold icon pack FREE&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the poll showed that the majority of you would like to get our &lt;strong&gt;fold icon pack for free&lt;/strong&gt; and because we love you more than how young Clark Kent loved Lana Lang we kept our world and &lt;strong&gt;we made the icon pack free&lt;/strong&gt;. So, what are you waiting for - &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.icons_fold&quot;&gt;GO GET IT ON GOOGLE PLAY!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.icons_fold&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Get it on Google Play&quot; src=&quot;https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to conclude this post, here have a photo of St. Valendtines day toy. Although, to be honest it can also represent how bears born near chernobyl look like. :&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ermahgerd, free icon theme!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#555555;&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In Bulgarian there is a saying “δеʒпʌатен оδяg няма”, which means “there is not such thing as free lunch”. If we say that this saying exists in various variations in most in not all languages, there is a good 99% chance, we won’t be wrong. However as you know in the world of open source this is one of the maxims that for better or worse is not entirely true.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#555555;&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We are currently in the process of, erm … re-evaluating our monetising and general strategy on Google Play and because of that we’ve decided to put on a leotard and dance to rather infamous Michael Sembello song. Ok, ok, ok, not that, although that would be hilarious, just not for us. :P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, cheap jokes aside - what we’ve really decided is to &lt;strong&gt;make one of our themes free of charge.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, you read that correct. One of these three themes &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.icons_hexagon&quot;&gt;hexagon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.icons_square&quot;&gt;square&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.icons_fold&quot;&gt;fold&lt;/a&gt; will become free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus we’re giving you the &lt;strong&gt;ability to choose which one will get free by voting &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/b/115833527622591803679/+NumixProjectOrg/posts/4qtP5WxnkqQ&quot;&gt;on this Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.ggpht.com/d6m15TjkwW0W9kpXFaHzr_5lND6DnWSTLeG24spWam5budXXKYcPDCatPe2APW1KFBo=h900-rw&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wait, there is more&lt;/strong&gt; - the source files of the selected theme will get uploaded on GitHub under a &lt;strong&gt;Open Source license&lt;/strong&gt;. How cool is all of that, eh? Oooops, almost forgot - the selected theme will become free on &lt;strong&gt;14th of February&lt;/strong&gt;. However, you’re not getting a plush teddy bear and a box a chocolates with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For we started the article with a maxima, allow us to finish it with one. Way back in the day Niccolo Machiavelli - an Italian historian, politician, diplomat, philosopher, humanist, and writer become associated with the saying “the end justifies the means” and we can it is somewhat applicable to our strategy re-evaluation when it comes to Google Play. Don’t worry, we’re not doing anything evil or illegal, but rather simply rolling out ads for our Android apps. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.numixproject.torch&quot;&gt;Torch App&lt;/a&gt; came with ads build in, which you can remove by tapping the remove ads button and chucking some Money at our screens. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.calculator&quot;&gt;base and free Calculator app&lt;/a&gt; got an update, which introduced ads on exiting the preferences pane, which you can avoid by buying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.calculator_pro&quot;&gt;Pro version&lt;/a&gt;, which also comes with plenty of other neat features. Our Hermes app will also come with ads, which you will be able remove for some price, which is an action that will also grant you access to pro features like additional themes and more.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.numix.icons_circle&quot;&gt;Circle Icon Theme&lt;/a&gt; also got ads. On that note - the theme that gets free of charge will be the next product in the Numix Android line to get ads. Don’t worry, the ads will only show up within the app from which you apply the theme and not anywhere else, so the chances are you might not even notice them much.
Now dearies, go and vote.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Folders, folders, folders, they are ready for your love</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#555555;&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In case you are wonder from where we came up with that article title - in 1987 an Italian artist called Sabrina recorded a song called “Boys, boys, boys” that become quite the talk in the disco town. The song contained the lyrics “Boys, boys, boys, get ready for my love”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now to business -  as you know, very recently we pushed &lt;strong&gt;new folders design&lt;/strong&gt; in our base icon theme and new folders apps icons for our circle, square and non-uniformity icon themes. 
Well, the last is kept at super secret repository, but if you know where to look, you can find it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-m3zmC297hT0/VMu4cPpmJtI/AAAAAAAAL7I/L2T1pUTTIng/w628-h435-no/NFIP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Numix Folders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w1Oi77gPknw/VMu4cIqCVWI/AAAAAAAAL7A/o_7R4_GG620/w628-h449-no/fl-p.png&quot; alt=&quot;Numix Folders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2nWcguyFYR8/VMu4b9YZZjI/AAAAAAAAL7E/Et3ouz8s54Y/w628-h449-no/fl-c-p.png&quot; alt=&quot;Numix Circle Folders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SAY_183Yxf0/VMu4cVUDxzI/AAAAAAAAL7M/GAqt5_bztFU/w628-h449-no/fl-s-p.png&quot; alt=&quot;Numix Square Folders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you might not know is why we redesigned them.  Well, the reason can be summarised in one reason - &lt;strong&gt;consistency&lt;/strong&gt;. You see with the old folders design you had one design for the folders icon themselves, another for the symbols for circle and square icon themes. The issue become even more prominent with the non-uniformity icons, because the old design was not meant to work as an app icon. We didn’t fancy that consistency at all, so the icons had to be redesigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we introduced in the new design was &lt;strong&gt;new shapes&lt;/strong&gt; for the folder body, &lt;strong&gt;new colours&lt;/strong&gt; (taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.co.uk/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette&quot;&gt;Google’s material palette&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;strong&gt;sheet&lt;/strong&gt; between the folders tiles and a &lt;strong&gt;slight shadow&lt;/strong&gt; below the folders to folders to add a spice of 3D look. The &lt;strong&gt;inset shadows&lt;/strong&gt; were also redone to play well with this new design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve crispy looking folder on no matter which zoom level you use your file manager, we have created all the folder icons for &lt;strong&gt;all the sizes&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;code&gt;16x16, 22x22, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 96x96, 128x128, 256x1256&lt;/code&gt;. The symbol to tile ration is identical for all the sizes and in 16x16 size we use plain orange symbolics, because these icons are too tiny to have a symbol over a tile design and are used mostly in sidebars and a symbol over a tile design would not work that well in sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
