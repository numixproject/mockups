So, today is 14th of February and unless you are really out of the loop, you should know that most countries celebrate St. Valentine's day also known as the day of love. The historical St. Valentine was a before schism third century Roman priest that. During the High Middle Ages, the day on which he is commemorated - 14th of February, became associated with Courtly love and that tradition evolved in today's day about all things love, cuddling, plush toys and chocolate boxes. We shall however not dwell more on that, because there is very little confirmed historical info about this person.
Those of you who don't have a person with which to celebrate St. Valentine's day and feel blue about that should know that in Bulgaria 14th of February is also the day of people who make wine, so you can sit quietly at home and drink wine whilst watching "Vampire Diaries". Just make sure you watch episodes with Katherine in them. :)
