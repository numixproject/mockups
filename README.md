# bolt_rpm_packager
A Automated RPM Package creator [Currently For Numix Themes Only. ] 

###Current Status
I wouldn't recommend using this script at the moment as it is not yet complete and is under work. 

###AIM 
To create a simple packager that automates the updation of version in the SPEC file and create a RPM package automatically.

###Targeted towards
This is specifically being scripted for the Numix/Shimmer Themes project but can be changed according to the requirements.
